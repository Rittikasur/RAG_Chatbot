They occur in everything that we do and see, fromshopping and cooking, to throwing a ball and playing games, to understanding weather patterns and using technology.The search for patterns and their explanations can be a funand creative endeavour. It is for this reason that mathematiciansthink of mathematics both as an art and as a science. This year, wehope that you will get a chance to see the creativity and artistryinvolved in discovering and understanding mathematicalpatterns",

Recall that the very first numbers we learned about in the study of mathematics were the counting numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, … Then we learned that there are even more numbers! For example, there is the number 0 (zero), representing nothing, which comes before 1. The number 0 has a very important history in India and now in the world. For example, around the world we learn to write numbers in the Indian number system using the digits 0 to 9, allowing us to write numbers however large or however small using just these 10 digits. We then learned about more numbers that exist between the numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, … , such as 1 2 , 3 2 , and 13 6 . These are called fractions. But are th",
